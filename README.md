pygametree
==========

Python Game Tree implementation

This code base is meant to provide a framework to build up game trees for various games.
The game tree will provide for a complete or incomplete description of a game allowing for
a computer opponent (or a human armed with the tree) to know all possible outcomes of each
move.  This provides the evaluation of a game as a game of skill or a game of knowing the 
right moves.
